**Figure 1a.**  Comparison of the risk of incident HCC between propensity score-matched cohorts in patients with T2DM. Outcomes were followed for 5 years after the index event (prescription of GLP-1RA vs. specific non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medication classes (but not both) in 1/2010-2/2019). Hazard rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the probability of outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied. Overall risk = number of patients with outcomes during the follow-up time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. A plus sign (+) indicates that a patient was prescribed GLP-1RA or non-GLP-1RA anti-diabetes medication, while a minus sign (-) indicates that they were not. DPP-4 indicates dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors; SGLT2, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, SU, sulfonylureas, TZD, thiazolidinediones.
